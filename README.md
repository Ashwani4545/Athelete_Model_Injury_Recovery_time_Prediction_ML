# 📘 Athlete Injury Recovery Time Prediction – Machine Learning & Flask Application

📌 Project Overview
This project aims to build a Machine Learning–powered web application to predict the recovery time of athletes after an injury based on structured medical and training data.
The project currently includes:

A Flask-based web application

OTP-based authentication system (via SMS API)

A structured dataset (injury1.csv) containing athlete injury records

Backend routing and session management

Project scaffolding prepared for ML model integration

🔧 The machine learning model is not yet integrated — this README outlines both the current system and upcoming ML workflow.
